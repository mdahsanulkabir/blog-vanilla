## Preface

I have started my web development journey since beginning of January 2022. Since then I have learnt the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Javascript, React and some other libraries. But after one and half year. I am still not confident about what I have learnt. Sometimes, I forget basics. The main reason behind this is that I guess the course I have taken during the first half of 2022 was to fast and I had a day job to do. So, in combination, I coutld not got enough time to practice. Fortunately, I had previous experience in C/C++/C#/Python programming which helped me to instantly understand what the Javascript code is trying to do. But due to lack of practice and right path, I think I am lost. For this reason, I have decided to re-start my journey and go with proper learnnig path.

To record my new journey, I have decided to log it in this blog project starting from HTML on August 13, 2023.

Initially I decided to write with only what I learn. But later I realized that as I will include code blocks, it would be nice if I include the basic usage of syntax highligher like HightlighJS of something like this. In addition, as I will use external libray I might need to use a bundler. That why I took help from Vite as a build tool.

Thats it !

I wish myself a successful learning of web development !!!
