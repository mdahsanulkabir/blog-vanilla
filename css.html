            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.</p>
            <p>Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It is a style sheet language used to style the HTML elements.</p>
            <p>For example - below is an example of css ruleset.</p>
            <pre><code>
                p {
                    color: red;
                }
            </code></pre>
            <p>This above code can be used to change the color of the text of a paragraph in to red.</p>
            <p>Here, p represents the selector, "color: red;" represents the declaration (where, "color" is the property, and "red" is the property value). We can have multiple declarations under a selector.</p>
            <p>Therefore, we can say that CSS ruleset is a combination of 'selector' and 'declaration'.</p>
            <p>Within each declarations we need to use semicolon (;). Check below code.</p>
            <pre><code>
                p {
                    color: red;
                    width: 500px;
                    border: 1px solid black;
                }
            </code></pre>
            <p>To style multple elements with same ruleset, we can separate multiple selectors with comma (,).</p>
            <pre><code>
                p,
                li,
                h1 {
                    color: red;
                }
            </code></pre>
            <h2>CSS syntax</h2>
            <p>CSS is a rule based language. We define the rules by spcifying groups of styles that are applied to particular elements or groups of elements on the web page. <br>Note: When multiple groups implement rules on an element, <mark><em>specificity</em></mark> come in to place and define which rule should be applied. Specificity will discussed later.</p>
            <pre><code>Example:
            h1 {
                color: red;
                font-size: 5em;
            }
                
            p {
                color: black;
            }
            </code></pre>
            <p>Above code presents a stylesheet of two styles. Where, the first style makes all the h1 elements (however, a document supposed to have only one h1 header element) in red color and font size as 5 rem. Second style applies to all paragraph elements and makes those elements in to black color.</p>
